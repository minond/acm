`acm - another configuration module` is a configuration reader. it can retrieve
values from command line arguments, environment variables, and local files of
different formats.

NOTE: acm and Configuration (capitalized) may be used as synonyms of each other
throughout this document.

#### locations

`acm` will make sensible decision about where to check for configuration. For
example, when checking for:

* arguments: defaults to `process.argv`
* environment variables: defaults to `process.env`
* files: defaults to `$PWD/config/`

this is also all configurable:

```js
var Configuration = require('acm'),

// use defaults
var config1 = new Configuration();

// or overwrite any one of these settings
var config2 = new Configuration({
    paths: [ 'myconfigs/', 'node_modules/hey/config/' ],
    env: {
        github: {
            username: 'minond'
        }
    },
    argv: {
        github: {
            name: 'Marcos Minond'
        }
    }
});
```

#### `.get(path)`

running `config.get('github.username')` will result in the following checks:

1. a `--github.username` command line argument will be checked
2. a `GITHUB_USERNAME` environment variable will be checked
3. a file named `github.{json,json5,yaml,yml,ini}` will be checked and parsed
for the value

that is the default preference of where the data comes from, but it can be
modified by updating the contents of `acm.prototype.readers`

##### file extension and parsers

available extensions are: `.ini`, `.json5`, `.json`, `.yaml`, and `.yml`. parsers
for each of these extensions are located in `acm.prototype.parsers`. adding new
properties to this object will add support for addition file extension.

##### file merge fields

files can use merge fields. [lodash's template](http://lodash.com/docs#template)
function is used to merge data into string, and `acm.prototype.fields` is passed
as the `data` argument. by default `.fields` comes with a reference to `process`
and the same `env` variable used to check environment variables (which could be
`process.env`)

#### `$*`

methods and properties whose name starts with `$` are considered non-public
and you won't get a major version bump with they change, in any way. so use at
your own risk.
